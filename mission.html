  <h1>Dean Russell Gadberry SBS Fundraising</h1>
    <p>I am excited to share that I am attending the School of Biblical Studies(SBS) in Kansas City from March through December of 2021. This is where I believe God is leading me in this season, and this will be beneficial to future ministry opportunities.</p>
  <h3>Future Goals in the 10/40 Window</h3>
    <img src='images/1040window.PNG' alt="10/40 Window Map">
    <i class='subtext' style="font-size: .7em;">The 10/40 Window is the rectangular area of North Africa, the Middle East and Asia approximately between 10 degrees north and 40 degrees north latitude.</i>
    <p>I have a vision to be a missionary in the 10/40 window. I want to reach this region because it is unevangelized and needs strong believers to share the word. Approximately 61% of the individuals in the 10/40 Window live in an unreached people group. You can find out more, HERE, on the Joshua Project Website. I am excited to bring an understanding of the bible with me, when I am able to go again.</p>
    <p>You may be wondering why I am not in the Middle East right now. I did not expect God to present the opportunity for me to stay in the USA this year, but He has been preparing me for it.</p>
    <p>The prophetic words from my time in Dubai varied from “Eat the Scroll” to “God is telling me you are going to be spending a lot of time studying the word”. I did not understand what God was saying through this, and was having trouble “studying the word” while I was actually studying frontier missions in the middle east. I’ve come to find that SBS is the fulfillment of this prophecy.</p>
  <h3>SBS is...</h3>
    <p>From YWAM KC’s Website:</p>
    <p>The School of Biblical Studies is a 9-month Bible study course where Scripture is studied using the inductive approach.</p>
    <p>These next 9 months will be a time of earnestly digging into the scripture and devoting myself to reaping the benefits. The homework so far includes: reading all 66 books of the Bible chronologically, creating charts to remember what each book of the Bible is about, using the Inductive Bible Study Method, researching ancient culture, and doing ancient-language word-studies.</p>
  <h3>God doesn’t call the equipped, He equips the called.</h3>
    <p>I feel like God is suiting me up for battle. Ephesians 6:17 even says that “the sword of the Spirit is the word of God”.</p>
    <p>I may not yet be equipped to enter foreign soil and tell people The Truth of Jesus. But, I am confident that a better understanding of the Bible will transform my ministry capabilities.</p>
    <p>And when this all comes to pass, I am so excited to share the moments with you.</p>
  <h3>Finance</h3>
    <p>I have trusted in the Lord to pay for this program, and I am so thankful to everyone who has already donated to my long-term vision.</p>
    <p>I humbly ask that you would consider financially supporting the next 9 months of my ministry career. My total expenses for this 9-month training program are expected to be $16,500. As of June 20, 2021, I only need to raise another $9000.</p>
